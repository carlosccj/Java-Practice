Java Practice problems of University

A bunch of problems in Java from the University that use a lot of the main features the language offer, including data structures, interfaces, herency structures and some more or less complex modelling/functions. I still take a look at them sometimes when I don't remember anything.

They also include some work on Threads and parallel programming, which I have to revise.
